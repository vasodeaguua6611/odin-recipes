    <p>Ready for some creamy, spicy dish? El Aji de Gallina is a <strong>weird</strong> Peruvian chicken stew that's like a warm hug for your taste buds! This dish combines shredded chicken in a rich, creamy sauce made with aji amarillo peppers, bread, milk,
        and walnuts. It's comfort food with a Peruvian twist!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken breast, poached and shredded</li>
        <li>4 slices white bread, crusts removed</li>
        <li>1 cup milk (for soaking the bread)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup walnuts, ground</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons aji amarillo paste (our beloved yellow pepper!)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth (from poaching the chicken)</li>
        <li>4 yellow potatoes, boiled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 hard-boiled eggs (because eggs make everything better!)</li>
        <li>Black olives for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the bread in milk until soft and mushy (about 10 minutes). Then blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, saut√© onion and garlic until the onion is translucent and soft.</li>
        <li>Add the aji amarillo paste and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring constantly (don't let it burn!).</li>

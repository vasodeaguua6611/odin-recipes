    <p>Â¡Bienvenidos! Ready to make the most iconic Peruvian-Chinese fusion dish? Lomo Saltado is a <strong>stir-fried beef</strong> dish that perfectly represents Peru's unique cuisine. As a kid, i used to love this dish! I grew tired of it lol, but anyways</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef tenderloin, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 red onions, sliced into thick wedges</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, cut into thick wedges</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups french fries (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 aji amarillo (yellow chili pepper), sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        <li>White rice for serving (because double carbs = double happiness!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your french fries first - either fry them yourself or bake frozen ones until crispy. Set aside but keep warm.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until smoking. Add the beef strips in small batches and sear until browned (about 2-3 minutes per batch). Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same wok, stir-fry the onions and aji amarillo until the onions start to soften. Add garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and cook just until they start to release their juices but are still firm.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the wok, add soy sauce and vinegar. Toss everything together quickly.</li>
        <li>Add the french fries and cilantro, give it one final toss (careful not to break the fries!)</li>
        <li>Serve immediately over rice while everything is hot and sizzling!</li>
    </ol>
